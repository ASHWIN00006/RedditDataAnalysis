📊 Toxic Behavior in Reddit Gaming Communities – Final Year Project (MSc Data Analysis for Business Intelligence)
📝 Project Description
This repository contains the complete implementation of my final year dissertation project titled "Toxic Behavior in Reddit Gaming Communities", undertaken as part of the MSc in Data Analysis for Business Intelligence at the University of Leicester. The aim of this project was to explore and analyze toxic behavior in online gaming communities on Reddit using a combination of data science, network analysis, and natural language processing techniques.

Toxicity in online spaces can significantly affect community health, user retention, and the overall experience of digital interaction. In gaming communities—where passion, competition, and subcultures collide—this toxicity can be particularly pronounced. This project aims to identify toxic users, evaluate their network influence, and recommend removals to improve sentiment while minimizing disruption to the community's social structure.

🎯 Objectives
Identify users who demonstrate toxic behaviors based on patterns of interaction, sentiment scores, and posting behaviors.

Construct and analyze the social interaction network of Reddit users in selected gaming communities.

Measure centrality, cohesion, and community clustering using Gephi.

Use sentiment classification (via SVM) to assess the tone of user posts.

Propose recommendations to reduce toxicity by identifying 10 users whose removal would increase average sentiment with minimal impact on the community structure.

🧪 Tools & Technologies Used
Reddit API + asyncpraw – for efficient asynchronous data scraping

Python (pandas, nltk, sklearn) – for data processing, sentiment scoring, and topic modeling

NLTK + VADER + SVM – for sentiment analysis

Gephi – for social network analysis and interactive visualizations

Excel + Power Query – for dataset cleaning, integration, and metric calculation

GitHub – for code versioning, documentation, and project sharing

📥 Data Collection
Reddit data was gathered from five active gaming subreddits between January 1, 2025, and April 15, 2025, using the Reddit API. For each submission and comment, key data fields were extracted, including:

submission_id, comment_id, parent_id

source_author, target_author, post_score, comment_score

post_title, text, created_utc, date, and time

The network was formed by mapping reply relationships (source_author → target_author).

🧼 Data Cleaning & Processing
The raw dataset underwent thorough preprocessing:

Deleted/null entries removed

Duplicate interactions dropped

Timestamps standardized

Submissions and comments separated using ID structure

Directed edge lists created for network modeling

Sentiment scores generated using a hybrid VADER and SVM approach

🌐 Network Analysis (Gephi)
A directed social interaction network was constructed in Gephi, where:

Nodes = Reddit users

Edges = Interactions (comments/replies)

Node Attributes: in-degree, out-degree, sentiment, clustering coefficient

Edge Attributes: source → target, date, score, topic

ForceAtlas2 layout was applied for network visualization, and modularity analysis was performed to detect sub-communities (clusters).

Metrics computed include:

Degree Centrality (In/Out) – to identify active vs. isolated users

Clustering Coefficient – to measure cohesiveness

Betweenness Centrality – to detect influential users or gatekeepers

Closeness Centrality – to assess how easily a user can reach others

Reciprocity – to evaluate mutual interaction

🔍 Toxic Behavior Identification
Users were evaluated using a combination of quantitative metrics and sentiment data. Specific toxicity indicators included:

High out-degree, low in-degree (broadcast behavior)

Low clustering coefficient and reciprocity (isolation)

Consistently low sentiment and negative post scores

Frequent targeting of specific users or controversial topics

After ranking users using these combined signals, 10 users were shortlisted for potential removal. Network simulations revealed that removing most of these users improved sentiment while preserving structural integrity.

📈 Key Visualizations
Gephi-generated visualizations included:

Modularity class grouping

Ego networks for key influencers

Node sizing by centrality, coloring by clustering coefficient

Community-wide connectivity and sentiment distribution

📌 Recommendations
Remove low-reciprocity, low-clustering broadcast users with poor sentiment histories

Retain structurally central but high-participation users to preserve community engagement

Use clustering coefficient, sentiment, and betweenness centrality as a composite toxicity score for future moderation models

Implement time-series tracking to monitor network sentiment shifts after interventions

📚 Future Work
Apply dynamic network modeling to capture time-based toxicity patterns

Incorporate sarcasm/slang detection to improve sentiment accuracy

Automate author flagging and dashboarding with real-time data ingestion
